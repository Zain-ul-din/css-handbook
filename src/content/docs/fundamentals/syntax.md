The basic rule structure of CSS is divided into two parts selector and declaration block.

```css
h1 {
  color: red; /** Single Declaration **/
  /* key: value */
}
```

In this code, `h1` is the selector, and all the code within the braces is the `declaration block`. A declaration block is composed of one or more declarations, and each declaration contains a key-value pair, where the key is the property name.
